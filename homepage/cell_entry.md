# Effects of mutations on HA-mediated entry into MDCK-SIAT1 cells

## Interactive heatmap
The heatmap below shows how mutations affect cell entry and allows you to mouseover specific mutations. Light gray tiles indicate mutations that were missing (not measured) in the library and the `X`'s indicate the amino-acid identity in the A/Massachusetts/18/2022(H3N2) strain. 

Click on the expansion box in the upper right of the plot to enlarge for easier viewing, or click [here](https://dms-vep.org/Flu_H3_Massachusetts2022_DMS/htmls/entry_MDCKSIAT1_wrapped_heatmap.html) to open the plot in a stand-alone window.

## Numerical values
The **pre-filtered** numerical data plotted on this page can be found [here](https://github.com/dms-vep/Flu_H3_Massachusetts2022_DMS/blob/main/results/summaries/Phenotypes.csv). Alternatively, the **unfiltered** data are available [here](https://github.com/dms-vep/Flu_H3_Massachusetts2022_DMS/blob/main/results/func_effects/averages/MDCKSIAT1_entry_func_effects.csv). Note the unfiltered data have not been filtered for QC criteria like `times_seen`, so either make sure you understand the filters in the file or we recommend just using the pre-filtered data.
